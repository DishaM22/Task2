# Task2
In this task, we analyzed the Arbacia dataset to understand the data better using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. First, we checked how complete the dataset is and looked at summary statistics like average, minimum, and maximum values. Then we used visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore the patterns, trends, and outliers. This helped us find any missing values, unusual data points, and how different features in the dataset are related. Overall, this step helped us understand the structure of the data before doing any machine learning.
